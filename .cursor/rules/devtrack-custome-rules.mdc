- The project is DevTrack: an open-source, lightweight API observability SDK for FastAPI and Django.
- Design philosophy: zero-config, minimal overhead, developer-first experience.
- Avoid suggestions that require external infrastructure unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer embedded, local, or in-process solutions over external services.
- Keep runtime performance and request latency impact minimal.
- Treat DevTrack as a library, not a SaaS product.
- Favor simplicity over feature richness; fewer features done well is preferred.
- All changes should align with observability needs: traffic, errors, latency, logs.
- Avoid adding business, billing, or enterprise features.
- Documentation should be simple, honest, and example-driven.
- Code changes should be incremental and backward-compatible when possible.
- Assume contributors may be first-time open-source contributors; keep things approachable.
- If a proposed feature increases complexity without clear developer benefit, question it.
- If a solution violates DevTrack’s zero-config philosophy, suggest alternatives.
- If something feels premature for an early-stage open-source project, call it out.
